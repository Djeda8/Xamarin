## Put button with command.

1. Start from a project with basic MVVM.

2. Place button control in the MainView.axml view.

3. In the MainViewModel class declare the DelegateCommand of the button.

> Note: To allow text on the button in lower case, we must indicate in the style file, inside the Resources / values ​​folder. In the MainTheme, we will set the value of textAllCaps to false.
